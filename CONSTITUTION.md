# QA Dashboard Project Constitution

**Based on the Five-Layer Context Architecture**  
**Success Rate: 30% → 90%+ with systematic context engineering**

> "Context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step." — Andrej Karpathy

## Core Philosophy

**Context engineering is the discipline of designing and building dynamic systems that provide the right information and tools, in the right format, at the right time, to give an LLM everything it needs to accomplish a task.**

This constitution ensures that all AI interactions within the QA Dashboard project follow a systematic, layered approach to context engineering.

QA Engineering and Test Management Domain

Domain Knowledge:
- Test case lifecycle: Creation → Execution → Validation → Reporting
- Test categorization: Functional, UI/UX, Integration, Regression
- Test environments: Development, Staging, Production
- Test result tracking: pass/fail/blocker status with detailed notes
- Bug tracking integration with test execution

QA Terminology:
- Test Case: Specific scenario with steps, expected results, and priority
- Test Result: Execution record with status, environment, and tester
- Test Suite: Collection of related test cases
- Regression Testing: Re-running tests after changes
- Blocker: Critical issue preventing further testing
- Environment: OS/device/version configuration for testing

Industry Standards:
- IEEE 829 Test Documentation Standard
- ISTQB Test Process Guidelines
- Agile Testing Practices (Continuous Testing)
- Risk-based Test Prioritization
- Traceability between requirements and test cases

QA Workflows:
1. Test Planning: Define scope, approach, and resources
2. Test Design: Create test cases with clear steps
3. Test Execution: Run tests and record results
4. Defect Management: Track and resolve issues
5. Test Reporting: Analyze results and metrics
6. Test Environment Management: Maintain consistent test environments

Quality Metrics:
- Test Coverage: Percentage of requirements tested
- Pass Rate: Percentage of tests passing
- Defect Density: Bugs per feature/module
- Test Execution Rate: Tests completed per time period
- Mean Time to Resolution: Average time to fix issues
</domain_context>
```

## Layer 3: Task Context (Implementation Standards)

```xml
<task_context>
QA Dashboard Development - Implementation Standards

Implementation Standards:
- Use existing project structure and naming conventions
- Follow established database schema patterns
- Implement proper authentication/authorization
- Include loading states and error boundaries
- Optimize for both desktop and mobile usage

Performance Expectations:
- Database queries execute in <200ms for normal operations
- UI components render without blocking
- Real-time updates propagate within 1 second
- Support concurrent users without data conflicts
- Handle large datasets (1000+ test cases) efficiently

Quality Assurance:
- Code review before major changes
- Test critical paths manually
- Validate data integrity after schema changes
- Check security implications of new features
- Document breaking changes and migration paths
</task_context>
```

## Layer 4: Interaction Context (Communication)

```xml
<interaction_context>
QA Dashboard Development - Communication Standards

Communication Style:
- Use clear, technical language appropriate for developers
- Explain complex concepts with practical examples
- Break down large tasks into manageable steps
- Provide reasoning for architectural decisions

Feedback Mechanisms:
- After implementing features: "Does this implementation meet the requirements?"
- When making architectural changes: "Should we update the documentation?"
- Before database changes: "Have you verified this won't affect existing data?"
- After complex operations: "Let's verify this works as expected."

Error Handling:
- Database errors: "Let me check the schema and provide a proper migration."
- Type errors: "I'll update the TypeScript definitions to match the implementation."
- Performance issues: "Let me analyze the query and suggest optimizations."
- Authentication failures: "Let's verify the session management configuration."

Clarification Procedures:
- When requirements are ambiguous: "To clarify the scope, should this feature..."
- When multiple approaches exist: "I see two approaches: [A] and [B]. Which aligns better with..."
- When impact is unclear: "This change affects [systems]. Should we..."
- When priorities conflict: "This involves trade-offs between [X] and [Y]. Let's prioritize..."

Development Workflow:
- Start with understanding: "Let me first understand the current implementation..."
- Plan before coding: "Here's my approach: [steps]"
- Validate assumptions: "I'm assuming [X]. Is this correct?"
- Confirm before major changes: "This will modify [system]. Shall I proceed?"
</interaction_context>
```

## Layer 5: Response Context (Output Standards)

```xml
<response_context>
QA Dashboard Development - Output Standards

Code Output Format:
1. Brief explanation of changes (2-3 sentences)
2. Implementation code with proper TypeScript types
3. Database migrations (if applicable)
4. Testing considerations
5. Additional notes for deployment/configuration

File Organization:
- Use existing project structure: src/components/, src/app/api/, etc.
- Place new migrations in database/migrations/
- Update type definitions in src/types/index.ts
- Add documentation to claudedocs/ for significant changes

Code Standards:
```typescript
// Clear interface definitions
interface TestCase {
  case_id: string;
  project_id: string;
  // ... rest of properties
}

// Proper error handling
try {
  const result = await query(sql, params);
  return NextResponse.json(result.rows);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error);
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Operation failed' },
    { status: 500 }
  );
}
```

## Core Principles

1. **Start simple, scale based on need** - Single components → Complex workflows → System integration
2. **Structure dramatically improves consistency** - Use the five-layer approach consistently
3. **Examples often outperform lengthy instructions** - Show concrete implementations
4. **Testing drives quality improvement** - Validate assumptions systematically
5. **Error handling prevents repeat failures** - Encode learned patterns from experience

## Implementation Guidelines

### For All AI Interactions:
1. **Always begin with the full five-layer context** when starting significant work
2. **Reference this constitution** when making architectural decisions
3. **Update layers as project requirements evolve**
4. **Use the structured XML format** for complex prompts
5. **Document deviations** from these standards with reasoning

### For Development Tasks:
- **Layer 1** rarely changes (core QA Dashboard role)
- **Layer 2** occasionally updates (QA domain knowledge)
- **Layer 3** adapts per task (specific requirements)
- **Layer 4** standardized (team communication)
- **Layer 5** varies by output type (code vs docs vs analysis)

## Quality Metrics

When this constitution is followed systematically:
- **Consistency**: Predictable, professional outputs
- **Efficiency**: 30-50% reduction in clarification cycles
- **Quality**: Higher accuracy and fewer errors
- **Maintainability**: Clear context for future modifications
- **Team Alignment**: Shared understanding of standards
